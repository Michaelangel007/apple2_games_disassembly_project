# Conan: Halls of Volta

It was one of the first Apple 2 games to use a 1-bit [stencil buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_buffer) for foreground/background objects.

# ProDOS

qkumba did a [1-sided file conversion.](http://pferrie.epizy.com/misc/lowlevel16.htm?i=1)

He closed with this cheeky statement:
